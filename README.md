# âœ¨ Welcome to My Front-End Portfolio\! âœ¨

Hello\! Thanks for checking out the codebase for my personal portfolio. This project is built using **React** to showcase my work, skills, and experience as a Front-End Engineer.

This README provides a quick guide to getting this project up and running locally.

## ðŸš€ Built With

This project was initially bootstrapped with **Create React App (CRA)**, giving it a solid foundation for rapid development and optimization.

## ðŸ’» Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    cd [YOUR_REPO_DIRECTORY]
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. This is your go-to command for local development\!

The app will automatically open in your browser at: [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000).

The page will smartly reload whenever you make changes to the code.

### `npm run build`

Prepares the app for production deployment.

This command bundles React, optimizes the code, and creates the finalized, high-performance files in the `build` folder. The built files are minified and ready to be hosted on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

### Other CRA Scripts (`test`, `eject`)

For advanced development or testing, the standard Create React App commands are also available:

- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner.
- **`npm run eject`**: **(Use with Extreme Caution\!)** This is a permanent, one-way operation that gives you full, manual control over the webpack and Babel configurations.
